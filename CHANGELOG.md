# Changelog

All notable changes to kanbanr are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Documentation viewer renders **Mermaid** diagrams (fenced ```mermaid blocks) and **embedded
  images** with per-folder relative resolution (any PNG/SVG asset; PlantUML/Graphviz/D2/Excalidraw
  export to an image and embed).
- Light/dark theme toggle (persisted; honors OS preference) plus mobile-responsive layout and
  accessibility improvements (focus-visible, reduced-motion, ARIA labels).
- VS Code extension scaffold under `editor/vscode/` (thin viewer + command layer over the local
  data folder).
- Packaging as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/`) bundling the skill and enforcement hooks,
  with cross-platform (PowerShell) hook variants.
- Open-source scaffolding: dual `LICENSE-MIT`/`LICENSE-APACHE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `THIRD_PARTY` notices, GitHub issue/PR templates, Dependabot, and a release
  workflow.

### Changed
- Relicensed the workspace to **MIT OR Apache-2.0** (was MIT) — the Rust-ecosystem norm.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

First public-candidate release.

### Added
- One binary `kanbanr`: a local, git-backed CLI **writer** plus `kanbanr serve`, a read-only
  view daemon (localhost, no accounts) over the same folder.
- `kanbanr-core` engine: YAML/markdown store, `dispatch` router, vendored-libgit2 commits +
  optional remote pull/push, per-project activity changelog, markdown/JSON export, validation
  (workflow transitions, milestone + cross-feature dependency DAG cycle detection, task
  auto-complete).
- Feature items with code/specification/status/milestone, persistent todo-lists, and fields for
  kind, priority, due date, labels, and cross-feature dependencies.
- React + Vite read-only monitor: project tiles, kanban board, status/feature/milestone/schedule
  pages, documentation viewer (with image assets), filter/search, filterable activity streams, and
  live SSE updates.
- Claude **skill** + enforcement hooks (SessionStart/Stop) making kanbanr the project's system of
  record.
- Optional Docker image and a two-layer test story (Docker-less integration + a testcontainers
  packaging smoke).
